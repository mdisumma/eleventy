<h2>Blog 1</h2> 
<h3>Students should introduce themselves and outline their career aspiration.</h3>
    <p>Although I remember myself having my first working experience when I was in secondary school, I never had much thought about career aspiration. I grow up in the family business, and I got busy working very soon, so after the diploma, I was already a skilled chef even dough my studying was in art and design.</p>
    <p>At that time, I didn’t mind to be involved, my family have been through some trouble, and I was eager to do my part. When things got better, I realise that I spent years in that state of acceptance, and I felt like those horses with blinders pulling carriages, and my priorities in life except for the sense of responsibility were numb.</p>
    <p>I admit I had to stretch a bit the muscle of my memory looking for bits of personality lost on my way. The first step was to get back in education, memories from college remind me, my talent for technical drawing and how fun it was to define solution related to functionality during the design process.</p>
    <p>I spent the last two years committed in self-development, and I studied web and graphic design as a result of my passion for art and technology. Still, most important, I allowed myself to set a new starting point to develop a career that reflects better my qualities and aspiration.</p>
<h2>Blog 2</h2> 
<h3>Students should discuss and reflect upon previous work and learning experience relevant to their career.</h3>
<p>During the time spent in college studying web and graphic design, I was determinate to improve my skills at my best and get better from some mental health condition. I was seeking a place to practising my studying and release social anxiety, so I started to volunteer as a teacher assistant in the same department of the college where I was studying.</p>
<p>The experience of learning and support helps me to understand better the power of sharing with others because when like-minded people come together, they usually complete the knowledge of each other, and mutual support becomes the key to grow up as a community, leaving nobody behind.</p>  
<p>It is essential also to understand how the working environment affects worker and their performances. Also, how the implementation of British values can instruct professionals to comply with colleagues properly works in the interest of the company to create the best condition to express everyone’s potential and avoid disruption in the workflow.</p>

<h2>Blog 3</h2> 
<h3>Students should identify their current strength/weaknesses and highlight areas for development.</h3>
    <p>During the first term at SAE institute, I had the time to practice and build my skills with programming languages and academic writing. I also have the opportunity to improve my graphic design skills when it comes to design layout and deal with image format. The ability to manage software to create and publishing made my job more fun, because I have to admit that approaching new tools sometimes can be frustrating and require patience and commitment at the begin, but my practice paid back, and I had a good time developing my first website.</p>
    <p>Where I struggled much has been the academic writhing and reflective portfolio, despite the lack of grammar, I had to deal with low confidence in promoting myself and define a career plan. I am coming from a totally different working environment, and my working experience doesn't match the new requirements. So early, I realise that technical skills are not enough to ensure a career in the web industry and more work need to be done in term of writing and networking.  </p>
