# {{ articletitle }}
I am passionate for art and technology, and eager to turn this passion into a career.
I built my foundation in graphic and web design at WAES (Westminster Adult Educational Service), and recently I have started a new exciting degree in web development at SAE Institute.
I want to thank all the people who kindly supported me during these years, and If you are a student and face the same struggle I do, my suggestion is to be patient and perseverant, results are coming!
During this time of uncertainty, I want to remind everyone how important it is to stay connected. Therefore, if you are a creative person who needs support or looking to start a new exciting project, please drop me a message.
