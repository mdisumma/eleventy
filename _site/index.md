Passionate for art and technology, and eager to turn this passion into a career.Therefore, I built my foundation in graphic and web design at Westminster Adult Educational Service (WAES) and recently, I have started a new exciting degree in web development at SAE Institute.
I want to thank all the people who kindly supported me during these years, and If you are a student and face the same struggle as I do, my suggestion is to be patient and perseverant, because the results are coming soon!
During this time of uncertainty, I want to remind everyone how important it is to stay connected. Therefore, if you are a creative person who needs support or looking to start a new exciting project, please drop me a message.
