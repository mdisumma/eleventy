<h1>What is your learning style?</h1>
<p>Since I started my education, I have never been conscious of the way I am learning.This question came across to me during a class I attended at University just a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>That morning, after the teacher had introduced a learning standard model, he had moved the focus of the lesson on how to identify our learning style. Soon the class came over an exercise aims to define better the learning profile of each student better.</p>
<p>Because so far I never considerate “to learn how to learn”, at the begin I was a bit confuse about al the story. Even though I was aware that human process information by three main categories (Auditory, Visual, and Kinesthetic), this knowledge did not help my analysis. Because If I had asked to guess, I would have instead defined myself Visual.</p>
<p>Because so far I never considerate “to learn how to learn”, at the begin I was a bit confuse about al the story. Even though I was aware that human process information by three main categories (Auditory, Visual, and Kinesthetic), this knowledge did not help my analysis. Because If I had asked to guess, I would have instead defined myself Visual.</p>
<p>Am I a kinaesthetic? Accordingly, with learningstylequiz.com: I am 15% Auditory, 33% Visual, and 52% Kinesthetic. I was surprised just for a moment from the unexpected outcome even though after a brief reading of the profile characteristics, the final result starts to make sense to me.</p>
<p>The website underlines for this type of learner, the aspect of getting involved and fully engaged with the learning experience and external stimulation, as the key to success.</p>
<p>Even more impressive was how we engage the experience. While I was reading, I have found out that the use of markers, sketches, and other similar recording medium are not visual, but related to a kinaesthetic learning approach. The recording experience creates a unique link for the learning process, and the information gathered is crafted inside a reflective mind map and personal note full of colours and strokes.</p>
<p>I had to go through some school memories to identify the similarity between successful and frustrating experience during my education. Nevertheless, the learning required to advance working positions and personal development was another aspect to consider. I wanted to understand what I am good at and why, and while I was scrolling backwards in my memories, the pattern becomes more evident. My learning process speeds up when I am getting a hand on what I am learning, rather than dive deeply into theory. I found myself better engaged in learning by doing.</p>
<p>The most recent example is related to the last two years when I was committed to studying for a diploma in graphic design. I remember to spend some days having lectures in class and others by volunteering. During that time, my job was to assist students like me with practical exercises, and it worked out well. I realised that the time I had to explain something to someone was the best time for me to learn too.</p>

<h2>Three scenarios for the future of climate change</h2>
<p>We well all know climate changes has become a critical matter for the generation ahead.We have a report dated 1965, which evidence how the effect of burning fossil fuels will be deleterious for the future of human being. In 1970, another report from the Department of Energy (USA) was predicting changes for the West Antarctic ice sheet.</p>
<p>In the last three decades the Industrial Revolution have spewed two hundred billion metric tons of carbon, and global temperatures, have continued to rise in a way that any five years we recorded a new warmest record.Unfortunately, the premise leads to some discomforting predictions.</p>
<p>If nothing change, it is granted that glaciers and ice will continue to melt, and radical changes will be even more specific for different ecosystem present of the globe. The most realistic scenario we could wish for would be to stop the emission of carbon and create new demand for clean and renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>According to a report of the International Energy Agency, some technologies already available, such as offshore wind turbines could provide to (USA) twice as the energy currently uses with an estimated increase of jobs request created from the renewable industries.</p>
<p>An alternative scenario is where global emission continues to grow along with global inequity. Developed nations will challenge issues by tailored solution, such as storm-surge barriers, outdoor air-conditioning, leaving the other nations on their own.</p>
<p>A study published in 2019 by Noah Diffenbaugh and Marshal Burke, both of Stanford University, found that in that country, where the emission of carbon is least of the average of industrialized nations by the twenty-five per cent the economy is growing slower ending in make this country poorer.</p>
<p>The third scenario is where the climatic calamities push the population to mass migration and global conflict, destabilizing the international political order and the global trading network.</p>
<p>The constant raise of the human population creates demand for more resources; its evolution not fully integrating organically anymore. The planet Heart is far older than our society; consequently, any attempt of humans to alter the natural developments of the planet ecosystem is likely to fail, and humanity may need to adapt to a more challenging environment.</p>
